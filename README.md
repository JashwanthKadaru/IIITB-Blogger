This is a web application and will be built in two parts: `react client app` and `server hosting rest API` for the platform. On the client side, we use `react JS` and `react router` along with `HTML` and `CSS`. On the server side, we use `node js` and `express JS` frameworks to build the `REST` API. Whenever the client hits one of the API endpoints `(URLs)`, the server will do some operations and sends back the result. This might involve making changes to the database. Databases are used for persistent storage of data and also efficient retrieval of data. For the Database, we will be using `mongoDB`, which is a `noSQL` type of database system which stores data in a manner similar to javascript object notation `(JSON)`. To interact with the database via server code, we use the `mongoose` library which comes through the npm package manager. This will let us create code-based schemas for the objects to be stored in the database and make noSQL queries to retrieve data using javascript.
